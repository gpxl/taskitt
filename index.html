        You know an online presence is a key part of your business success but it's suffering from a lack of attention.
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your contact info is out of date</li>
        <li>Your layout has errors</li>
        <li>You can't track visitors the way you would like</li>
        <li>You're unsatisfied with your current web host and want to move but don't know how to make it happen</li>
        <li>You want to make sure you're using best practices to rank well in search engines</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Oh, and that "really amazing and inexpensive" developer your friend recommended?
      </h2>
      <p>
        They're unreliable and have completely disappeared leaving your website in shambles and your business at risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        These scenarios are surprisingly common and the solution is clear. It's time to stop hiring from the bottom of the barrel. But what's a small business owner to do when good developers start at a $100/hour minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wouldn't it be great if there was someone you could rely on to take care of all the little things so you can stop worrying and focus on building your business?

            Gerlando is a life saver! Well, not an actual life saver, but a super reliable resource for helping fix all the little things I never have time (or knowledge) to fix. Whether he's turning a PSD file into HTML/CSS or making something magical happen in Wordpress, he's fast and easy to work with. I'd highly recommend his services to anyone!
