      <h2>
        Oh, and that "really amazing and inexpensive" developer your friend recommended?
      </h2>
      <p>
        They're unreliable and have completely disappeared leaving your website in shambles and your business at risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        These scenarios are surprisingly common and the solution is clear. It's time to stop hiring from the bottom of the barrel. But what's a small business owner to do when good developers start at a $100/hour minimum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wouldn't it be great if there was someone you could rely on to take care of all the little things so you can stop worrying and focus on building your business?

            <span class="fa fa-quote-left"></span> I've worked with Gerlando on all types of projects over the past year. He is one of the rare breeds of developers who is both personable and savvy. He has always gone above and beyond to ensure the project is done well, all while communicating where he's at in the process. He has even taken time to teach me tips and tricks during each project. It's been a joy to work with him and I look forward to every opportunity to work with him again. Don't be silly...hire him. <span class="fa fa-quote-right"></span>

Well, not an actual life saver, but a super reliable resource for helping fix all the little things I never have time (or knowledge) to fix. Whether he's turning a PSD file into HTML/CSS or making something magical happen in Wordpress, he's fast and easy to work with. I'd highly recommend his services to anyone! <span class="fa fa-quote-right"></span>
